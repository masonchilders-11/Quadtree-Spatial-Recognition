# Quadtree Spatial Recognition Project

## Overview
The Quadtree Spatial Recognition project is an innovative system designed to harness the power of quadtrees to achieve efficient spatial recognition. Leveraging quadtree algorithms, this project can quickly identify spatial relationships among a myriad of points, optimizing performance and resource usage.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Spatial Recognition**: Utilizes quadtree structures to effectively divide space and recognize spatial patterns.
- **Interactive User Interface**: A dynamic and user-friendly interface that allows users to engage with the system and observe quadtree processes in real time.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users have the flexibility to adjust parameters, providing control over the granularity and depth of the spatial recognition process.
- **Highlight & Detect Feature**: Enables identification and highlighting of specific areas of interest within the quadtree.

## Ackowledgements
